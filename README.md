# Coursera-Basic-Deeplearning
This Repository contains my Jupiter Notebooks in HTML format from the basic deeplearning.ai courses on Coursera.  
Code is documented in great detail in the provided html copies of the Jupiter Notebooks. (More complex Deeplearning Models such as RNNs and CNNs have their own repositories.) 
* Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a contains a logistic regression binary cat image classifier.
* Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer_v6c demonstrate the advantage of Neural Networks over logistic regression with a single hidden layer on a planar data classification task. 
* TensorFlow_Tutorial_v3b contains a basic neural network for immage classification of American sign language numbers implemented using TensorFlow. (My CNN repository demonstrates how convolutional and residual networks perform on this task.)
* Deep_Neural_Network_Application_v8 demonstrates how deeplearning methods improve the performance of computer vision systems on the cat image classification task. 
* Intitialization, Optimization_methods_v1b and Regularization_v2a contain various common performance improvement tools for machine learning models.
